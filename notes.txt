Need:
Reward Function R(s): probably 1 stroke
Transition Function: defines a transition T where being in state S and taking an action ‘a’ takes us to state S’ - given in text file
    Probability Function: P(S'|s,a) - given in text file
Utility Function = R(s) + max( discount*( (prob * each option) ...+... () ) )
